# Renames a bunch of files in a directory (NOT recursive)
# with an increasing number (counted for each file extension),
# surely obeying the original extension.
#
# This was necessary for me after sorting out duplicates of
# some files w/ my older `index.sh` (which perfectly fits to
# this one - maybe you want to use both together? ;-) ...
#
# So also take a look at my older `index.sh`!
# Both together are better. :-)
#

#
# TODO # nothing here yet! but i'm going to write this soon..
#
# # dynamic extension (each w/ own counter)
# # optional prefix and suffix!
