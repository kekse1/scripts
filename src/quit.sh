# Kinda tiny "management" of exit and it's codes. ...
#
# So the plain `quit` function will use either a counted
# exit code (see below @ `quits`) or a random one (see
# below @ `rand`) if none is specified as first argument,
# or if [[ $1 == "+" ]]; ...
#
# The `rand` will be used then to return a pure *random*
# exit code between [ 1 .. 255 ].
#
# And the (most important) `quits` function can be called
# by you (or by `quit` if first parameter equals "++"!)
# any time you do *not* exit in your bash shell scripts
# but want to (++) count the next exit code to use l8rs.
#
# So the reason is: every error case in my scripts should
# exit with a next exit code. And I got tired of counting
# them on my own - so e.g. when I inserted another one
# somewhere above, I had to shift all following ones (to
# keep it *really* clean..); etc.
#
# Now you can just call `quits` for every possible error
# where you don't exit (so this error was false). And if
# l8rs some error occurs, you just have to `quits ++` or
# smth. like it. ;-)
#
# So, this is a really simple script. But I wouldn't want
# to miss such logics right now (after many own scripts).
